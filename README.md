## How to clone this repo to your local machine?

1. The easy way **(not recommended for kohol)** is to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your local machine and clone the repo using the following command:

```bash
git clone
```

2. The still pretty easy way (recommended for kohol) is to download the repo as a zip file and extract it to your local machine.
