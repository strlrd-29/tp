## How to clone this repo to your local machine?

1. The easy way ⚠⚠ **(not recommended for kohol)** is to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the repo on your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strlrd-29/tp.git
```

2. The still pretty easy way **(recommended for kohol)** is to download the repo as a zip file and extract it to your local machine inside the www folder that you will find in the installation folder.
